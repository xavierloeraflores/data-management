## Business Scenario

HealthFit Innovations is an healthcare technology company on a mission to build innovative solutions that improve patient care and healthcare management. The company is developing a new healthcare data platform called "HealthTrack" for collecting, analyzing, and presenting key insights into patient data that needs to be stored in a database. Since the platform is designed to integrate data from various sources, the current relational database solution is struggling to cope and scale with the influx of complex and dynamic data coming into the platform. The company is seeking a non-relational database solution that can handle their data needs, while ensuring that the solution is scalable, flexible, and efficient.
